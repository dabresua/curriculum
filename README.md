Hi, this is my personal site. Currently, it only contains my curriculum vitae.

I use [md2html](https://github.com/dabresua/md2html) to convert from markdown to PDF and HTML.

# How to generate the CV

The files `DBS_CV_remote.pdf` and `index.html` are generated from markdown using the `md2html` library.

To configure your environment run:

```bash
make config
```

To build the files use the following command:

```bash
make
```
