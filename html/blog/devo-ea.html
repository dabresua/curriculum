<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
The <a href="https://docs.devo.com/space/latest/119668818/Endpoint+Agent">Devo Endpoint Agent (Devo EA)</a> is a multi-platform and multi-purpose endpoint monitoring solution that allows Devo
customers to recollect a variety of datasets sitting in their infrastructure, process them in an efficient way, and create
a comprehensive view that spans multiple applications and use cases in areas such as security monitoring, IT health and performance
monitoring or capacity planning.
</p>
<p>
Built as a wrapper of Facebook’s <a href="https://osquery.io">Osquery</a> monitoring tool, Devo EA leverages its baseline capabilities with the necessary components
to allow a seamless integration with Devo’s analytics platform. Furthermore, additional key functions not originally present in the
default implementation have been introduced by Devo using Osquery’s standard extension mechanism.
</p>
<p>
The result is a highly performant and versatile endpoint instrumentation tool that copes with the needs of organizations concerned
about the visibility of their infrastructure, as well as the effective collection of their related information.
