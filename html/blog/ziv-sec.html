<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://www.se.com.sa/en">SEC</a> launched the “digital transformation of the distribution networks” project in December 2019 with the Smart Metering Project (SMP)
as a key factor in its strategy to improve the service to the end customer. The so-called SMP system fully automates the meter reading and billing process.
In addition, it will allow the customers to examine their energy usage in real time to improve their consumption patterns.
</p>
<p>
The Smart Metering Project (SMP) is identified as the Saudi Electricity Company most important project for digital transformation having installed over
10 million smart meters in record time.
</p>
<p>
The ZIV meter deployed is a modular design with integrated dual technology, PLC PRIME 1.4 and NB-IoT. It is a flexible smart meter that incorporates a
unique sealed holster designed to host a pluggable communications module (LTE Cat 1). It is both, PLC-PRIME 1.4 certified on all channels and OIML R46 certified.
</p>
<p>
This dual communication technology represents an important technological milestone for ZIV. The Spanish company, a pioneer in the deployment of smart
grids, with more than 10 million smart meters operating worldwide.
